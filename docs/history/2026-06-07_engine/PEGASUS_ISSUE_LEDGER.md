# PegaSUS Master Issue Ledger

Cross-cutting **status tracker** for every documented issue/feature/objective across all
modules and dev cycles. Orthogonal to [`DOCS.md`](DOCS.md) (which says *which doc governs
what*): this says *what state each issue is in*. Update the Status cell — with a commit hash —
whenever an item advances, so we always know what is done, in flight, deferred, or needs
revisiting. The LDO/EFG-inference layer keeps its own detailed ledger in
[`PEGASUS_LDO_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md`](PEGASUS_LDO_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md); this file governs
everything else and indexes that one.

## Status legend

- **OPEN** — documented, unbuilt, verified genuinely absent.
- **OPEN?** — reported open by inventory but NOT yet live-verified (treat as a lead, not a fact).
- **WIP** — in progress this cycle.
- **DONE `<commit>`** — built + verified + landed.
- **VERIFIED-DONE** — audited against live code this cycle and found already-satisfied (no build).
- **LIKELY-DONE `<commit>`** — inventory + commit trail indicate done; not re-verified this cycle.
- **DEFERRED `<why>`** — deliberately not now; reason required.
- **SUPERSEDED `<by>`** — a later analysis/decision overrode the documented prescription.
- **DEFENSIBLE** — flagged by a critic but audited as correct-as-is (record why, don't "fix").

## How this ledger was built (2026-07-08 inventory)

Six read-only agents inventoried the non-LDO authority docs in parallel; every promising
"open" was then cross-checked against live code. **Headline finding: the codebase is well
ahead of its own docs.** Most doc-listed findings are already DONE or DEFENSIBLE; the agents
repeatedly flagged as "open" things that live code already satisfies (they read stale strata —
`COMPLIANCE_AND_REMEDIATION.md` is a finding-ID dictionary, not a plan; the math/roadmap
critiques predate the WP1–WP8 + O1–O19 LDO build). Trust the **Status** column here, not the
source docs, and re-verify any **OPEN?** before building.

## → Forward plan of record: [`PEGASUS_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md`](PEGASUS_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md) (2026-07-09)

Settled roadmap after three user reframings: **full national×temporal (2000–2024) is the DEFAULT**
(data-layer + out-of-core are first-class, not deferred) · `data/` is accreted → storage contract +
GC · **RaceBridge is an ecological, not individual, problem** → reformalized as a hierarchical Poisson
ecological-deconvolution model (the small shared confusion matrix `C` is the identifiability
mechanism, refined from a literature prior; posterior `λ_{s,j}` rates propagated with uncertainty).
Phased: P1 full-scale-readiness + integrity + W-RACE-1 · P2 live-test + W-RACE-2 ecological C + W-REG-1 ·
P3 polish · P4 studies. Highest-leverage next: DP-3 bounded-memory national streaming.

## Repo-health assessment (2026-07-08) → [`PEGASUS_REPO_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md`](PEGASUS_REPO_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md)

Five-dimension deep review + a second wave of four improvement/redesign deep-dives (RaceBridge,
data-plane, registries, per-module — see the assessment's "Deep-dive redesign synthesis").
**Verdict: healthy + coherent; GO for a reduced-statewide live test.** New workstreams: **W-RACE-1**
(propagate bridge uncertainty downstream — code-only; RaceBridge is wired but its `C` is a placeholder
identity matrix) · data-plane parallel-normalize + byte-safe wins · **W-REG-1** (operationalize
vectorized transforms → "add data ≈ registry edit") · per-module robustness fixes. Priority list in
the assessment. Tiered remediation now driving the cycle:
T1 integrity (maternal_child_linkage truthfulness flag, delete `empirical_compression.py`, delete
orphaned `pirs/` pkg) · T2 health-registry typing/de-orphan (icd_curated_groups, cnes/sih shadow,
icd_catalog stub, diagnostic_topology/clinical_events typing) · T3 typed contracts (Q_tensor,
domain_summaries handoffs) · T4 byte-safe perf (covariance lag-loop, panel batch-align) · T5 gated
refactors (god-modules, REG-07). See the assessment for detail.

## Burn-down status (2026-07-08, autonomous)

Two verification+fix waves (10 agents total) drove the ledger to a terminal state. **The EFG-LDO
architectural-integrity gate — the user's stated prerequisite before any study — is MET.**

**Landed this cycle:** EFG-QT `11fce28` (canonical `classify_q_state` wired + count `denom_fragility`
fix) · T1.2 `56f0bdc` (DATASUS blocked→hard-fail, explicit partial-coverage, opt-in `require_complete`)
· PERF-02 (migration BFS fallback bounded, result-identical) · EFG-QT-residual `cfda05d` (**active
crash fix** — non-enum `state="warning"`). Full suite 506 green.

**Verified already-satisfied / defensible (no build needed):** MATH-12, MATH-05/06, KS-01, W11/HSIC,
SIDRA-CTX-01/02, STORE-02, STOR-03/05/06, ARCH-REG-02, SCOPE-01, PANEL-01, EFG-DECL-02, MOD-HELD
(test-only), FAL-POP-*, and the whole LDO layer. (The authority docs were stale; live code was ahead.)

**Remaining — none is an integrity gap; each is study-gated, design-dependent, or policy-deferred:**
- **FEAT-P3 export layer / FEAT-P4 multi-denominator** — the bundle already materializes all typed
  outputs to parquet; these add a *delivery/query interface* whose concrete shape is driven by the
  off-limits study's consumption needs. Best built to the study's real requirements, not speculatively.
- **POP-02 M6 / T1.8** — national-build memory perf; value is gated on running the (off-limits) national build.
- **DIS-07** — build-time label embeddings; large, low priority.
- **Policy-deferred:** causal P5, LDO GPU (measured-baseline gate), RACE-region (data-blocked),
  DIS-06 (intentionally unwired), ZIKA-ACCPT (aspirational + study-gated).

Conclusion: everything resolvable without a study-driven design decision or off-limits work is
resolved. The remainder is best sequenced WITH the study greenlight so it is built to real needs.

## ★ Genuinely-open priority set (verified or high-confidence)

| Rank | ID | Item | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FEAT-P3 + FEAT-P4 | **Output Query Layer** — self-describing hypotheses export + multi-denominator | output/denominators | **DONE `85a3ccc` (P3a–d); P3e CLI = only remainder** | design [`PEGASUS_OUTPUT_QUERY_LAYER.md`](PEGASUS_OUTPUT_QUERY_LAYER.md); **rate-recompute PRUNED** (no 2nd rate engine / denominator-CI math in a user-facing reader — LDO untouched). DONE + live-verified: resolver (FEAT-P4) + edge query/export + edge enrichment + P3c `count`/`raw_field` field-tensor reader (`output/query/field_tensor.py`) + **P3d `rate`** (`engine.py:_rate_query` — a SELECTION of the EFG's materialized RN ratio field by `num/denom` carrier, never a recompute); `standardized_rate` stays refused to the age-standardization engine. 25 query tests green. Remaining: **P3e CLI** wrapper only. |
| 2 | SIDRA-CTX-01 | Context (ST-DFM) routed to the EFG | sidra/efg | **DEFENSIBLE/DONE** | verified WIRED (`sidra_context._run_stdfm_for_context` → `field.support["stdfm"]` → EFG); `skipped` is intentional profile/regime gating, not an orphan |
| 3 | FEAT-P4 | Multi-denominator declaration (folded into #1) | denominators | **DESIGN DONE → implementing** | `denominators.yaml` registry + query-time resolver; see the Output Query Layer spec |
| 4 | DIS-06 + ZIKA-ACCPT | Disease variable-grammar + Zika acceptance | disease/efg | **DEFERRED** | DIS-06 intentionally unwired (σ_C is the canonical generator; grammar docstring warns vs a 2nd); ZIKA aspirational (Q02↔A92 graph edge 0.0, needs off-limits flagship inference) |
| 5 | POP-02 M6 (POPT-3) | Population build: numpy-native O(n_cells) construction | denominators | **VERIFIED-DONE** | `priors.py`/`layer1.py` use vectorized flat-index `np.add.at` scatter (byte-identical to the old `_cell_index` fill); only small S×T closure lists remain. Per-block emit (POPT-5) + parallel blocks (POPT-4) are low-value incremental perf, study-gated. |
| 6 | RACE-01 | RaceBridge region-conditioning | measurement | **DEFERRED (data-blocked)** | registry supports it (`region_scope`); needs empirical region-specific C (PNS/PNAD linkage) not in-repo + not fabricatable; study-adjacent |
| 7 | STOR-05 | Delete DATASUS stdout/stderr/heartbeat ancillaries on success | datasus | VERIFIED-DONE | already handled by `subprocess._cleanup_chunk_ephemera` on success |
| 8 | PERF-02 | Bounded-radius BFS in migration `hop_distances` | denominators | VERIFIED-DONE + hardened | live national path threads bounded `max_hops`; hardened the direct-call fallback (result-identical, drops O(N²) footgun) |

**Deferred by policy:** causal installment (FEAT-P5 / CAUSAL-THEME15 — Meek/faithfulness/DiD),
LDO-W11 Moran/HSIC dedup (behavior-identity check first), all LDO perf/GPU (LDO-NUM-01,
LDO-DESIGN-01/02, GPU-01…08, KS-02 — GPU gated on a measured CPU baseline), full residual
cross-fit, continuous-discovery scheduler (DISCO-01 / FAL-02, §VI.4 future feature).

## §LDO / EFG inference — CLOSED (detail: `PEGASUS_LDO_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md`)

WP1–WP8 + the O1–O19 re-verification wave landed; the later level-confounding and
CERT+lag-honesty clusters closed too. Live-verified this cycle as already-satisfied:

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| MATH-12 / LDO-WHITEN-04 | symmetric-normalized whitening Laplacian `L_sym` | VERIFIED-DONE (`precision.py:61`) |
| MATH-05/06 / ROAD-W1 | reliability-W in the (whitened) covariance moment | VERIFIED-DONE (`covariance.py:92,217`) |
| MATH-24 / MAJ-01 | spatial BYM varying-coefficient field | DONE `3370e67` |
| MATH-25 / MAJ-02 | disease Laplacian quadratic `(γ/2)tr(SᵀL_DS)` | DONE `f774e28` |
| MATH-02 / LDO-MARG-02 | per-muni EB baseline rate | DONE `d9f5524` |
| MATH-13 / LDO-ADMM-06 | ADMM dual-residual stopping | SUPERSEDED `empirically refuted — primal+dual → recall 0.0, reverted` |
| KS-01 | SLQ joint-logdet dormant at national S | DEFENSIBLE `sparse-Cholesky exact+cheap at S≈5570; SLQ is the S>20000 contingency` |
| KS-02 | `sparse_spd_logdet` uses splu not Cholesky | DEFERRED `correctness-neutral; 2× flops negligible at S≈5570` |
| LDO-CAUSAL-* | LiNGAM-pool / Meek / faithfulness / DiD | DEFERRED `P5 installment` |
| LDO-W11 | Moran + HSIC-kernel call-site dedup | DEFERRED `behavior-identity check required` |
| LDO-XFIT | full fold residual cross-fit | DEFERRED `marginal beyond n≥10·p gate` |

Remaining math-critique items flagged PARTIAL by the inventory (MATH-04 holdout re-gaussianize
leak; MATH-11 temporal pre-whitening vs telemetry-only; MATH-07 t-copula tail dependence;
MATH-08/23 exposure-uncertainty transport `σ_logE`) are **OPEN? — unverified leads**, low
priority, to be triaged against the LDO audit before any build.

## §Denominators / population tensor

Reconstruction code lives in `src/pegasus/denominators/reconstruction/`. GPU is gated last —
the verified bottleneck was a Python `tuple(float(...))` round-trip, since fixed.

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POPT-1/2 | kill tuple round-trip; numpy-native storage | VERIFIED-DONE (`schema.py` `_STORE_DTYPE=np.float32`, numpy `__post_init__`) |
| POPT-7 / FAL-POP-PROJ | coverage beyond 2021–2022 anchors (projection) | LIKELY-DONE `a34cdc6` (task #18) |
| FAL-POP-SV | single-vintage census-anchored closure | LIKELY-DONE (task #16; 6579 kept as recency anchor by design) |
| FAL-POP-AMC | municipality boundary-change harmonization | LIKELY-DONE `dcee9f1`,`b6e8d08` |
| FAL-POP-RECON | census undeclared-race reconciliation | LIKELY-DONE `ae04ff5` |
| POP-02 M6 / POPT-3 | numpy-native container construction | VERIFIED-DONE — `priors.py`/`layer1.py` vectorized flat-index `np.add.at` scatter, byte-identical; only negligible S×T closure lists remain |
| POP-MEM | national build RAM cliff (measured ~18–20 GB peak → OS thrash = the "~1 hour"; NOT solver time — solver does 0 iters) | **DONE** `5c3bebd`,`dc70151`,`163f062`,`2dcd155` — (1) skip/stream the 62-col×30.6M SIM read (was 10–20 GB, discarded when race unbridged); (2) columnar record pipeline (was ~6 GB list[dict]) + free source frame; (3) `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=0`; (4) POPT-5 blocked build. Peak → ~5–6 GB, stages seconds. All byte-identical (AL + 3-state block-invariance). See memory `population-solver-national-bottleneck` (corrected). |
| POPT-4 | parallelize the locality-separable blocked solve (ProcessPool/thread) | OPEN (perf, not correctness; the blocked build is now SEQUENTIAL per-block for memory-graceful peak — bounded parallelism is a speed lever, trades peak RAM) |
| POPT-5 | per-block build-solve-emit (input-prep peak O(block)) | **DONE** `2dcd155` — `_solve_locality_blocked` builds prior_mean/race/migration-bounds per block, solves, frees; peak O(one ~2M-cell block). Byte-identical to the whole-tensor build (AL == original; 3-state 11-block == forced single-block). User-required (memory-graceful on a loaded machine), so no longer "low value". |
| POPT-6 | document age×sex/race×age joints as IPF/independence reconstructions | OPEN (small) |
| PERF-02 | bounded-radius BFS in `migration.hop_distances` | VERIFIED-DONE + fallback hardened (result-identical) |
| POPT-8 / POP-02 GPU | torch port of `loss.py`+SPG (f32-bulk/f64-reduction) | **DONE (study-scale) `ee6df3b`,`ca1fd33`; national-gated `d714d7b`** — torch SPG solve, 8-term objective as autograd (machine-identical to numpy: 1e-16 f64 / 1e-7 f32), recovery validated (max 1.6e-7 relative-to-scale; totals 6.3e-8), **~16x the per-block solver**. GATED to study/state scale (≤`_GPU_MAX_SAFE_BLOCKS`=12 blocks, ~single UF): the full-national 68-block loop intermittently hard-segfaults (exit 139) from a native torch+polars transition race → national routes to the crash-free CPU path. Robust national-GPU = **subprocess isolation** (auto-retry past the transient crash + release build RAM on exit) — the documented follow-up. |
| POP-FLOW-01 | migration-flow refusal silently no-op'd at national (dense-pair > `MAX_DENSE_FLOW_PAIRS`) | **DONE `9517ab0`** — §V fix: `_reconstruct_and_persist_migration_flows` now returns a `skip_reason` + emits a `RuntimeWarning` when a reconstruction is attempted-but-refused (national dense refusal / graph unavailable / empty), recorded on the build manifest; the one legitimately-empty case (no net signal) stays quiet. Re-enabling national O→D flows needs a **sparse flow backend** (new open lead POP-FLOW-02). |
| POP-FLOW-02 | national O→D flow reconstruction (sparse backend past the 8000-pair dense limit) | OPEN (feature; the migration-affinity spatial kernel is opt-in, so contiguity is the honest national fallback today — now surfaced, not silent) |
| FEAT-P4 | per-query multi-denominator declaration | OPEN |
| ARCH-CTR-01 | unify `she/population` + `denominators/reconstruction` | OPEN? |

## §Measurement / race

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RACE-01..07 | RaceBridge redesign (per-source C, literature prior, never identity, uncertainty) | LIKELY-DONE (tasks #4,#20) except… |
| RACE-01-REGION | …region-conditioning of the confusion matrix | **DEFERRED (data-blocked + study-adjacent)** — registry already supports it (`region_scope` gating), but region-specific C needs empirical matrices (PNS/PNAD linkage by region) not in-repo and not fabricatable; national matrix is honestly flagged (`race_bridge_prior_uncalibrated_assessment_only`) |
| EFG-DECL-02 | race-declaration gate when race axis absent | VERIFIED-DONE — fails closed (`race_axis_metadata_missing_fail_closed`) |

## §Disease semantic axis

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DIS-01/02/03 | concept registry, ICD/CID adapter, DiseaseGraph | LIKELY-DONE |
| DIS-04 | L_D prior in LDO precision | DONE `f774e28` (quadratic) + adaptive-ℓ1 |
| DIS-05 | shared-code overlap accounting (`mechanical_overlap`) | LIKELY-DONE (enforcement gate unverified) |
| DIS-06 | semantic-expansion variable-grammar wired into live compile | **DEFERRED-by-design** — verified: `variable_grammar.py` is built+tested but intentionally NOT wired (its docstring warns against a *second* live generator; the EFG σ_C-restriction path is the canonical one). Wiring it as the sole generator is a future refactor needing a V_fields-equivalence pinning test, not a bug. |
| DIS-07 | build-time label embeddings (Qwen3-0.6B cached asset) | **DEFERRED (inconclusive)** — user: highly experimental, not worth pursuing while core architecture + central/impactful features + open issues/reviews remain; the structural `L_D` (DIS-04) already covers the core smoothness-prior need |
| ZIKA-ACCPT | autonomous Zika→microcephaly acceptance test | **DEFERRED** — no test exists; risk HIGH: cross-chapter Q02↔A92 DiseaseGraph edge is 0.0 (weak/absent coupling → discoverability uncertain, possibly aspirational), and the full-stack test needs the off-limits flagship inference. Revisit with the study. |

## §SIDRA / context

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SIDRA-CTX-01 | route ST-DFM context into the EFG | **DEFENSIBLE / DONE** — verified WIRED: `sidra_context._run_stdfm_for_context` runs the ST-DFM pipeline in-band; results embed in `field.support["stdfm"]` → reach the EFG; `compile.py:719` sets stage from the executed count. The `skipped` status is intentional gating (core_vital profile / direct-regime / no-context-artifact), not an orphan. |
| SIDRA-CTX-02 | high-cardinality axis bound / bounded pushforward on legality path | VERIFIED-DONE — `legality._high_dimensional_axes_ok` fails closed on unbounded high-dim SIDRA axes; seeded by `project_and_bound_context_facts` |

## §Output / schema

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FEAT-P3 / ROAD-W12 | export / materialization layer | OPEN (priority-1) |
| OUT-02 | `output_schema.yaml` scaffold doesn't drive `validate.py` (real contract in `output/schemas.py`) | OPEN? |
| OUT-03 | PROFILE_NONEMPTY + empty_by_profile rule in `validate.py` | LIKELY-DONE |

## §Compute / GPU / storage

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| STOR-01/02/07 | raw.rds decoupled; microdatasus audit-only; manifest tensor reference-only | DONE `61746bb` + v4 bridge |
| STORE-02 / T1.6 | lazy `scan_parquet` views (retire re-materialization) | VERIFIED-DONE — `_combine_processed_datasus_chunks` uses `scan_parquet`→`sink_parquet`; content-addressed `combined_hash` skips re-materialization on identical intent |
| STOR-03 | processed.parquet ZSTD vs SNAPPY | VERIFIED-DONE — `storage/parquet.write_table` defaults `compression="zstd"`; explicit in the combine write |
| STOR-05 | delete stdout/stderr/heartbeat ancillaries on success | VERIFIED-DONE (`_cleanup_chunk_ephemera`) |
| STOR-06 | SIDRA cache/facts duplication | VERIFIED-DONE — `extract.py` writes a slim provenance record (payload_sha256 + archive pointer); full payload only on HTTP error |
| GPU-01..08, LDO-NUM-01, LDO-DESIGN-01/02 | LDO perf: batched/truncated eigh, warm-start, whitening reuse, GPU HSIC | **MEASURED → NOT WORTH IT (2026-07-09).** Profiled the ADMM eigh port on a national-ish field (p=40, q=360): a single CUDA f64 eigh is 6.9x a numpy 1-thread eigh (17.9ms vs 122ms) and GPU-vs-CPU S agree to 2.6e-15 with identical edges — BUT (a) eigh is only ~60% of a fit (`pairwise_correlation` on the 122k-col feature matrix + whitening are the rest → single main fit only **1.76x**), (b) the dominant LDO cost (`stability_select`, 20 refits, 244s) **already parallelizes ~4.5x across CPU cores**, which a single GPU can't beat for independent refits, and (c) **batching is counterproductive at q=360** (GPU already compute-bound: batch=20 is 24ms/matrix vs 18ms single) — so the survey's "batch the ADMM eigh, 5-15x" is refuted; realistic net is ~1.7-2x with regression risk. Task-list #54 "W8 GPU done" is a **false-completion** (live code is numpy `np.linalg.eigh`, no `torch_admm.py`). Redirected per §III (match effort to measured value). The one clean slice (GPU eigh for the single main fit, machine-precision-identical, opt-in) is a possible future low-priority add. |
| DISCO-01 / FAL-02 | continuous-discovery scheduler + incremental update | OPEN (§VI.4 future) |

## §Modularity / architecture (structure)  — inventory 2026-07-08 (agent B, file:line evidence)

**W11 consolidation cluster (task #53) — WIP this cycle.** Retire duplicated logic to single
sources of truth; the safe subset first, the numeric ones (Moran/HSIC) with behavior-identity
verification.

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| MOD-02 | `_clean`/`_digits`/`_stable_hash`/`_read_table` reimplemented ~8× (6 files) → `core.text`+`core.io` | WIP |
| WF-11 | `_load_intent` reimplemented 4× (pipeline/compile/race_bridge/stage_plan) → `load_user_intent` | WIP |
| WF-01 | population-mode→solver-mode mapper duplicated byte-identical | WIP |
| WF-02 | name collision `_race_bridge_prior_artifact` (producer vs finder, opposite logic) | WIP |
| LDO-B08 | Laplacian `L=D−W` hand-rolled 4× (disease_prior/lowrank/geo) → shared helper (`normalized=` flag) | WIP |
| MOD-01/EFG-03 / MATH-22 | Moran's I: q_tensor's 1-D `_moran_contiguity` vs compile_attach adjacency | **DEFENSIBLE** — verified: the LIVE path uses geography-aware `_moran_i_adjacency`; the 1-D proxy is only q_tensor's documented no-graph fallback (emits `moran_i_ordering_contiguity_proxy`). n_eff also already unified (shared `_kish_effective_n`+`_moran_corrected_n_eff`). |
| LDO-B03/B04 | HSIC kernel "fork" | **DEFENSIBLE / FALSE lead** — `residual_scan` imports hsic's PUBLIC API (`build_hsic_representation`/`hsic_pair_stat_and_null`/`hsic_mode_for_n`/`_gpu`); no duplicate kernel, clean boundary (matches O9 intentional split). W11 cluster (task #53) fully dissolved: HSIC false, Moran defensible, core.text false. |
| **Data-integrity (silent-loss — matches full-data mandate):** | | |
| T1.2 | DATASUS per-chunk fail-closed completeness gate | DONE `56f0bdc` — `blocked`→hard-fail (broken bridge); `timeout`/`failed`→explicit PARTIAL-COVERAGE (not silent); opt-in `require_complete` threaded to national |
| T1.3 | national race-prior `= None` before UF fan-out (`pipeline.py:475`) | **DEFENSIBLE-BY-DESIGN** — verified: comment "UF-independent; wired later"; `compile.py:524` re-resolves via `race_bridge_plan`. Study-adjacent (race-stratified national) → off-limits scope; re-verify when that path is exercised. |
| **★ EFG-QT — canonical §3.12 Q-state now wired (DONE `11fce28`):** | | |
| EFG-QT / DIRECT-QT-01 | `_q_row` now derives the Q-tensor `state` from the canonical `classify_q_state` on the COMPUTED diagnostics (was a zero-caller orphan; state was the ad-hoc materialize-time `field.state`). Surfaced + fixed a latent denom_fragility bug: bare COUNT fields (n_denom None) were quarantined by a `1.0` default — now count-aware (0.0 for counts, 1.0 only for a rate missing its denominator), via shared `default_denom_fragility` used by both `_q_row` and `compute_q_state`. | DONE `11fce28` — 502 tests pass; probe confirms count→verified, broken-rate→quarantined |
| EFG-QT-residual | materialize-time `field.state` ad-hoc literals | DONE `cfda05d` — the non-enum `"warning"` state was an ACTIVE crash (FieldState("warning") ValueError on sim_informed_denominator mode; hidden because tests only use official_sidra_anchor) → `forced_fragile`; regression test pins the enum-coercion contract. Remaining declaration-vs-data-reliability gating reconciliation is a design nicety, not a bug (dashboard_safe tri-state is intentional). |
| **Megazord decomps (behavior-preserving splits):** | | |
| WF-07 | `compile.py` 1036-LOC god-module | OPEN |
| EFG-08 | `executor/kernels.py` 838 LOC, stringly-typed dispatch | OPEN (partial split done) |
| EFG-09 | `compile_attach.py` 674 LOC (orchestration+Q-recompute+serializers+attach) | OPEN |
| EFG-07 | `FieldNode.support/axes` untyped dict, 136 alias-probes | OPEN? |
| MOD-03 | layering inversion: `geo/migration_affinity` imports `denominators` | OPEN? |
| WF-08/09 | untyped compile→pipeline handoff; stage predicates derived twice | OPEN? |
| T1.6 / STORE-02 | `datasus_combined` re-materialized per run | VERIFIED-DONE — content-addressed combine (`combined_hash`) skips re-materialization on identical intent |
| T1.8 / POP-02 M2 | float32 denominator solver never built (peak RAM ~2× floor) | OPEN (perf; folds into POP-02 M6 build-memory) |
| REG-07-LOADER | registries still 21 files; Stack A/B duplication + codegen cruft (decode-path rewrite) | OPEN (task #28) |
| MOD-HELD | §1b straggler dead-code | VERIFIED test-only — `run_attach_race_bridge`, `build_sim_fixture_efg_run`, `ingest_sidra` have ZERO production callers (test/CLI-only; no integrity impact). Deletion is optional low-value hygiene, DEFERRED (needs per-test review to avoid breaking fixtures — don't trash working test infra). |
| ARCH-REG-02 | declarative source routing | VERIFIED-DONE — `config/registries/datasus/source_fields.yaml` declares a per-field `route` (Decode/Parse/PreserveMark); not hardcoded |
| SCOPE-01 / ARCH-PROFILE-01 | decouple DataScope × ExecutionStage | VERIFIED-DONE — `core/schemas.py` `run_profile` and `execution_stage` are orthogonal axes (documented) |
| PANEL-01 | CommonPanel wired | VERIFIED-DONE — `compile_common_panel()` built + called in `investigate.py:235`; consumed by `ldo/assemble.py` |
